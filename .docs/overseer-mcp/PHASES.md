# Project Phases

This file enumerates the phases required to deliver `overseer‑mcp` version 1.0.  Do not edit this file manually unless you understand the phase definitions; instead use the `overseer.update_phases` tool to modify it programmatically.

## Phase 1 – Foundation & Spec Lock
id: 1
status: current
description: Lay the groundwork for the project by capturing all requirements and writing the base documentation.
deliverables:
  - README.md
  - DESIGN.md
  - TOOLS.md
  - PHASES.md
done_criteria:
  - All base documents created and populated according to the MASTER‑OVERSEER‑PLAN
  - Global constraints and tool surface defined
  - Phase definitions written in PHASES.md and PHASE‑01.md
dependencies: []

## Phase 2 – Repo & MCP Server Skeleton
id: 2
status: pending
description: Set up the Node/TypeScript project scaffold with a working MCP server and stub tools.
deliverables:
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.json
  - src/server.ts
  - src/tools/* stubs
  - config/sentinel.yml
done_criteria:
  - Project builds with `npm run build`
  - MCP server starts and lists all stub tools
  - sentinel.yml contains basic structure (project_defaults, phase_templates, conventions, ci_cd)
dependencies:
  - 1

## Phase 3 – Core Planning Tools
id: 3
status: pending
description: Implement the tools that create and maintain phase plans (`plan_project`, `infer_phases`, `update_phases`, `status`).
deliverables:
  - Fully functional plan_project tool
  - Functional infer_phases and update_phases tools
  - Working status tool
  - Updated docs reflecting tool behaviour
done_criteria:
  - Running plan_project generates a coherent PHASES.md and PHASE‑01.md for any repo
  - infer_phases returns reasonable suggestions on a sample repo
  - update_phases correctly applies modifications without corrupting the file
  - status reports the current phase and statuses of all phases
dependencies:
  - 2

## Phase 4 – Phase Engine Tools
id: 4
status: pending
description: Implement tools that perform phase work (`run_phase`), enforce completion (`advance_phase`) and begin QA helpers (`lint_repo`, `sync_docs`, `check_compliance`).
deliverables:
  - run_phase tool capable of reading tasks from PHASE‑NN.md and updating checklists
  - advance_phase tool that locks phases when complete
  - Basic lint_repo, sync_docs and check_compliance implementations
  - Updated DESIGN.md and TOOLS.md
done_criteria:
  - run_phase marks tasks complete and generates missing stubs in both normal and bossmode
  - advance_phase refuses to advance if requirements missing, otherwise locks and advances
  - QA tools return sensible responses (even if simple)
dependencies:
  - 3

## Phase 5 – Config, Conventions, Docs & Integration
id: 5
status: pending
description: Flesh out sentinel.yml with realistic conventions, add Docker support and provide examples for generic MCP clients.  Align all docs with implementation.
deliverables:
  - Expanded config/sentinel.yml
  - Dockerfile and docker‑compose.yml for running overseer‑mcp
  - Updated README.md with usage instructions and client examples
  - Example MCP client configuration snippets
done_criteria:
  - sentinel.yml includes environments (vps.host, home.macmini, holo‑cube), domains and coding standards
  - Docker container builds and runs Overseer successfully
  - README.md describes running Overseer locally and in Docker
  - Example configuration demonstrates calling tools from a generic client
dependencies:
  - 4

## Phase 6 – Final QA, Hardening & Ship Review
id: 6
status: pending
description: Perform final quality assurance, add a test suite, improve logging and prepare release documentation.
deliverables:
  - Test suite for plan_project, status, run_phase and advance_phase
  - Logging strategy documented and implemented
  - CHANGELOG.md and RELEASE notes
  - All phases in this file marked as locked
done_criteria:
  - Tests run via `npm test` and cover happy paths and common failure cases
  - Each tool validates inputs and returns helpful error messages
  - Codebase cleaned and aligned with sentinel.yml coding standards
  - README.md, DESIGN.md, TOOLS.md and PHASES.md fully up to date
dependencies:
  - 5
